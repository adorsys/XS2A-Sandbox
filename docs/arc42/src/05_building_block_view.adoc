Motivation::

The application has micro-service architecture and uses Spring Boot 2.1.1. Every independent feature "xyz" maps to a top level package (`de.adorsys.psd2.sandbox.xyz`) (backend) or a top level folder (`src/app/xyz`) (UI). The UI is
implemented as an Angular app and bundled at build time in the backend JAR. The project consists of the _ModelBank_ and depends on XS2A and Ledgers.

| **Name**              | **Description**

| certificate-generator
| Create QWAC certificates to allow TPPs access to the XS2A API via SSL Client Authentication. Java module.

| developer-portal
| Provide documentation about the API (e.g. OpenAPI), supported use cases (XS2A), getting started and examples in one place. The content is static but embedded in the Angular app.

| oba-ui
| Online banking user interface that provides interface to test REDIRECT SCA approach when confirming consent, payment or cancelling payment. This module is Angular application.

| tpp-ui
| TPP user interface that helps to log a TPP in, create certificate for TPP, upload and manage test test data (users, bank accounts, transactions etc). This module is Angular application.

| online-banking              | Provides backend functionality for online banking UI. This module is a Java application.
| bank-profile | This module consists of 1 .yaml file with ASPSP-specific information (bank profile). The file can be configured depending on ASPSP features and restrictions.

| **Name**              | **Responsibility**

| PIS
| Provide the Payment Initiation Service implementation for XS2A (implements interface from `xs2a-impl`). Uses the _testdata_ module for the actual values.

| AIS
| Provide the Account Initiation Service implementation for XS2A (implements interface from `xs2a-impl`). Uses the _testdata_ module for the actual values.

| PIIS
| Provide the Payment Issuer Instruments implementation for XS2A (implements interface from `xs2a-impl`). Uses the _testdata_ module for the actual values.

| aspsp-profile (library)
| Expose the XS2A configuration via REST API. The actual values come from the top level _config_ module. Is provided by the `profile` library from XS2A and embedded in our ModelBank. Needed by `xs2a-impl` and not directly called by us.

Part of the https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a[adorsys PSD2 XS2A implementation].

| consent-management (library)
| Handle consents for us. Every payment or account information needs/creates a consent. Is
provided by the `consent-management` library from XS2A and embedded in our ModelBank.

Part of the https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a[adorsys PSD2 XS2A implementation].

| xs2a-impl (library)
| Provide the XS2A business implementation (e.g. validation, handling of consents via `consent-management`). Calls our own `AIS`/`PIS`/`PIIS` implementations.
