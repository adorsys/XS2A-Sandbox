== Design Decisions

Micro-service architecture::
+
Our project design features micro-service architecture making it flexible and easily scalable, yet simple and understandable.
Project consists of:

* Angular modules for the frontend (Developer Portal, Online Banking UI, TPP UI)
* Java based backend modules (XS2A Interface, Consent Management, ASPSP Profile, Ledgers, XS2A Gateway, Certificate Generator)
+

Stick to a Tech-Stack Commonly Found in Banks::
We try to be conservative in our tech choice. To reduce friction we use technologies that our potential
customers know and can handle.
+
Right now we use:

* Java 11 / Spring Boot 2
* Angular 9
* PostgreSQL
* Docker

Continuous development & update::
All projects included into Dynamic Sandbox are continuously developed and updated to latest BerlinGroup PSD2 Specification and
are always up to date featuring latest releases of all components.
