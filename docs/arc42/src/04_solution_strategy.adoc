.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape the system's architecture. These include

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the basis for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanation of these key decisions short.

Motivate what you have decided and why you decided that way,
based upon your problem statement, the quality goals and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.

The project bundles one top-level component: the _modelbank_. The _modelbank_ contains the XS2A API (with XS2A Interface, ASPSP-profile and Consent-management system), does the certificate handling, provides TPP UI, Online Banking UI and documentation in the developer portal.


=== TPP Certificate Handling

Issuing a real certificate just for testing purposes would be a bit too much effort, which is why the ModelBank acts as a TSP issuing Qualified Website Authentication Certificates (QWAC) valid only for the ModelBank. A QWAC is defined in https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN[eIDAS] and is implemented as a https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3739.txt[X.509] certificate.

For PSD2-purposes the certificate gets extended by the QcStatement containing appropriate values such as the role(s) of the PSP (see https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/119495/01.01.02_60/ts_119495v010102p.pdf[ETSI]).

After embedding the QWAC in the actual XS2A request, the role and the signature get validated at a central reverse proxy before it gets finally passed to the interface where the banking logic happens. The technical documentation of the XS2A interface can be accessed https://sandbox-portal.dev.adorsys.de/swagger-ui.html?urls.primaryName=PSD2%20API[here].
