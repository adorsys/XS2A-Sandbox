$ brew install plantuml jq
$ gem install asciidoctor
```

* create architecture documentation
+
```sh
$ make docs/arc42/modelbank-arc42.html
```

== Tools Used for Diagrams

We use https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] for simple diagrams. This allows us to put the plain text
diagram sources under the source control. PlantUML diagrams are put into the `diagrams` folder and
are named `*.puml`.

More complex diagrams (like the diagram in Deployment View) are created with https://draw.io, which is now completely free and even offers a https://about.draw.io/integrations[desktop app]. _draw.io_ diagrams are saved as XML, also put in the `images` folder.
