== How to Build

* check if you have _jq_, _plantuml_ and _asiidoctor_ installed
+
```sh
$ make check
```

* install if needed
+
```sh
$ brew install plantuml jq
$ gem install asciidoctor
```

* create architecture documentation
+
```sh
$ make docs/arc42/xs2a-sandbox-arc42.html
```

== Tools Used for Diagrams

We use https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] for simple diagrams. This allow us to put the plain text
diagram sources under source control. PlantUML diagrams are put into the `diagrams` folder and
are named `*.puml`. At build time we generate PNGs from them and put them in the ignored folder
`images/generated`.

More complex diagrams (like the diagram in Deployment View) are created with https://draw.io, which is now completely free and even offers a https://about.draw.io/integrations[desktop app]. _draw.io_ diagrams are saved as XML, also put in the `images` folder.
