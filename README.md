# ModelBank

This is the try-out version of adorsys ModelBank: an open source (AGPL v3) solution to get acquainted with adorsysâ€™ implementation of a NextGenPSD2 compliant dynamic sandbox. 

This software is delivered as-is and we're happy about any contributions done by the community to improve it.

For try-out version you can build the sources on your local machine. To do so, download or checkout the definite branch (branch name is actually a release name) and build it. For any further assistance, please contact us directly.

We currently focus on collaborative projects with our customers where our frameworks can be used as a basis for building new individual XS2A solutions.
If you are an organisation that would like to commercially use our solutions beyond AGPL v3 requirements, we are open to discuss alternative individual licensing options. If you are interested in working with us or have any other inquiries, please contact us under [psd2@adorsys.com](mailto:psd2@adorsys.com).

## What is it

With PSD2 Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Payment Services in the Internal Market, published 25 November 2016
the European Union has forced Banking Market to open the Banking Services to Third Party Service Providers (TPP). These services are accessible by TPP on behalf of a Payment Service User (PSU).

The 'Berlin Group' is a pan-European payments interoperability standards and harmonisation initiative. Based on the PSD2 and EBA RTS requirements, Berlin Group NextGenPSD2 has worked on a detailed [Access to Account (XS2A) Framework](https://www.berlin-group.org/psd2-access-to-bank-accounts) with data model (at conceptual, logical and physical data levels) and associated messaging.

ModelBank is a dynamic sandbox environment that allows to emulate and test ASPSP's OpenAPI PSD2 services.
Modelbank functionality supports all mandatory services of XS2A. Optional services are partially supported via UI interfaces, but fully supported and can be tested through XS2A interface.

ModelBank is based on [XS2A Service](https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a), [XS2A-connector-examples](https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a-connector-examples) and [Ledgers](https://github.com/adorsys/ledgers). ModelBank also uses Keycloak identity provider (IDP) for the security/token issues and for handling the system users.

With ModelBank [TPP UI](tpp-ui/), you as a testing TPP can access banking APIs directly, get TPP certificates and manage testing accounts. Administrators cannot login to TPP UI.

The ModelBank [Admin UI](admin-ui/) provides a user interface to manage administrators of the ModelBank, its users and TPPs. Please note, that TPPs cannot login to this application.

[Developer Portal](developer-portal-ui/) contains testing instructions and all the necessary documentation. Also, there is a possibility to send requests to XS2A system to proceed basic Payment and Consent flows available in test cases inside Developer Portal.

All four SCA approaches are supported: REDIRECT, OAUTH, EMBEDDED, DECOUPLED. Two of them (REDIRECT, EMBEDDED) are directly testable on Developer portal. For the Redirect SCA Approach an [Online Banking UI](oba-ui/) is used for authorisation and SCA.
